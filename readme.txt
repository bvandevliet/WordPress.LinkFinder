Find and fix broken links throughout your website.


== Description ==

<p>
  No more dead links. Speed up your website by avoiding redirects and improve your search engine ranking.
</p>

<p>
  Link Finder scans through the content of your posts, extracts the links it finds in all html "href" and "src" attributes and attempts to follow them. It lists all links that where redirected or broken, for example those that result in a 404 Page Not Found error. From within this list, you can easily make corrections and repair all inefficient links in one simple click.
